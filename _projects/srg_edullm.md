This project aims to revolutionize education at Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) by leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), specifically Educational Large Language Models (EduLLMs), for personalized learning. The initiative focuses on developing a system that utilizes LLMs, such as LLaMA2 and ChatGPT, to monitor and analyze student interactions with GAI tools. By doing so, it seeks to enhance teaching methods, improve learning outcomes, and tailor educational practices to individual learning styles.

Key components of the project include customizing LLaMA2 for educational purposes, analyzing the impact of ChatGPT on education, and evaluating how different learning styles interact with these technologies. The ultimate goal is to position HBKU as a leader in AI-driven education, addressing challenges such as student engagement and resource disparity, and setting a new standard for personalized learning through GAI.
