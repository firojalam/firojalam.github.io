## Islamic Media Ethics in the Digital Age  
**AI-Powered Solutions for Combating Misinformation and Promoting Constructive Cross-Cultural Dialogue**

This project, supported by the **HBKU Flagship Research Grant (3rd Cycle)**, investigates how **Islamic media ethics** can be systematically integrated into **AI-driven language and multimodal systems** to address misinformation, polarization, and ethical failures in today’s digital information environment.

The project runs from **2025–2027** and brings together expertise from **AI and Arabic NLP, Islamic studies, media ethics, and public policy**.

---

## Project motivation

Current AI systems for misinformation detection and content moderation are often developed using **generic or culturally narrow assumptions**, limiting their effectiveness and trustworthiness in diverse societies. In particular, Islamic ethical principles such as truthfulness (*ṣidq*), justice (*ʿadl*), responsibility (*amānah*), and avoidance of harm in Islamic sense are rarely operationalized in computational systems.

This project aims to close this gap by designing **ethically grounded, culturally aware AI systems** that reflect Islamic media ethics while remaining compatible with global norms such as human rights and international law.

---

## Research objectives

The project pursues four core objectives:

1. **Operationalize Islamic media ethics for AI**  
   Translate ethical principles from Islamic scholarship into computationally testable criteria for AI systems.

2. **Develop culturally grounded benchmarks and datasets**  
   Create evaluation resources for misinformation, harmful content, and ethical reasoning grounded in Islamic and cross-cultural contexts.

3. **Build AI models with ethical awareness**  
   Design language and multimodal models capable of context-aware fact-checking, responsible moderation, and calibrated uncertainty.

4. **Support constructive digital dialogue**  
   Enable AI-assisted platforms that promote respectful, informed, and dialogical engagement across cultures.

---

## Methodology

The project adopts an interdisciplinary and multi-layered approach:
- **Source grounding:** Islamic texts, trusted scholarly sources, international law, and human rights frameworks  
- **AI & NLP techniques:** multilingual and multimodal LLMs, Arabic NLP, explainability, and automated reasoning  
- **Evaluation:** benchmark-driven assessment, human-in-the-loop validation, and ethics-focused metrics  

---

## Expected outcomes

Key outcomes include:
- **Public datasets and benchmarks** for ethical AI and misinformation research  
- **Evaluation frameworks** for culturally and ethically grounded LLMs  
- **AI models and tools** for fact-checking, content moderation, and dialogue facilitation  
- **Digital literacy resources** aligned with Islamic principles of critical thinking  

All releases will follow open and responsible research practices.

---

## Team and collaboration

The project is led by researchers from **HBKU, QCRI and Doha Institute for Graduate Studies**, with contributions from:
- Artificial Intelligence and Arabic NLP  
- Islamic studies and media ethics  
- Public policy and cross-cultural communication
