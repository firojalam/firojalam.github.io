## Bangla Text to Speech

Led the team for the Bangla Text to Speech Project, aimed at developing a Bangla TTS system using the open-source festival engine developed by CSTR and the festvox tool from CMU speech group. The first version was publicly released on 19 February 2009, and is now available for download. This project was awarded as the most innovative project at BASIS Softexpo 2010 ([http://www.softexpo.com.bd/about.php](http://www.softexpo.com.bd/about.php)). It received a special award in the National E-Content and ICT4D Award 2010 ([http://www.eaward.org.bd/](http://www.eaward.org.bd/)). Developed the first audio version of Bangla newspaper "Prothom-alo". See news on [The Daily Star](http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=153325).

### This project involves the development of the following components:

- **Phoneme Inventory**: Conducted acoustic analysis to identify the total number of phonemes in the Bangla language. A small speech database was developed for this purpose.
- **Text Normalization**: Developed two text normalization tools using rule-based systems in Java and Scheme.
- **Letter to Sound (LTS)**: Developed an LTS system to handle unknown words and to create a pronunciation lexicon.
- **Pronunciation Lexicon**: Developed both manual and automatic LTS-based lexicons, containing 92K entries.
- **Intonation Modeling**: Conducted initial work on labeling speech corpus for intonation modeling.
- **Diphone Database for TTS**: Created a diphone database with 4355 diphones, including the design of nonsense sentences, professional recording, and labeling.
- **Speech Corpus**: Developed a speech corpus for TTS, potentially applicable in ASR, with approximately 100K words, 18K unique words, and 10K sentences. Professional recording and sentence-level labeling were completed. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/blp/files/Speech_Corpora/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/blp/files/Speech_Corpora/)
