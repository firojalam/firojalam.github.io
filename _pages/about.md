**Short Bio:** I am a **Senior Scientist** at the [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.unitn.it/en">University of Trento</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.disi.unitn.it/riccardi">Prof. Giuseppe Riccardi</a>. I also earned my masterâ€™s degree from the same department and completed my undergraduate studies at BRAC University. I have authored numerous peer-reviewed publications and contributed as LPI and PI to several local, international and EU-funded research projects. In addition to my research, I actively organize workshops and shared tasks, and I mentor students and junior researchers. My work focuses on advancing AI technologies for low-resource and underrepresented languages.

## Research Interests:

- AI/Deep Learning/Machine Learning: Large Language Models, Multitask, Mulingual and Multimodal Representation Learning

- Applicative Contexts: Natural Language Processing,  Behavioral and Social Signal Processing (Emotion, Personality traits) from Speech and Text; Social Media Text Analysis.
