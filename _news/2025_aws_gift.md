We have received a $50,000 AWS Credits gift through the Build on Trainium program to support our ongoing research in AI. This funding will empower our team to pursue the project "Native, Local, and Cultural Alignment in Multilingual and Multimodal LLMs," focusing on cutting-edge knowledge editing methods. Our aim is to enrich open-source language models with culturally grounded, multilingual, and multimodal data, promoting the development of more inclusive and contextually aware AI technologies.
