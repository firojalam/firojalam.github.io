## 🏆 New Grant Award: Islamic Media Ethics in the Digital Age

We are pleased to announce that our team has received an **HBKU Flagship Research Grant (3rd Cycle)** for the project:

**_Islamic Media Ethics in the Digital Age: AI-Powered Solutions for Combating Misinformation and Promoting Constructive Cross-Cultural Dialogue_**.

This project focuses on developing **AI systems grounded in Islamic ethical principles** to address pressing challenges in today’s digital ecosystem, including misinformation, online polarization, and cross-cultural misunderstandings.

## Why this matters

As AI-driven content moderation and misinformation detection systems become widespread, many still struggle with **cultural grounding and ethical context**, particularly for non-Western societies. Generic approaches risk overlooking culturally specific norms of truth, responsibility, and dialogue.

Our work aims to bridge this gap by integrating **Islamic media ethics** such as truthfulness, justice, and accountability in communication with **state-of-the-art AI and NLP**, enabling more **responsible, culturally aware, and trustworthy digital technologies**.

---

## Research team and collaboration

The project brings together an interdisciplinary team across **HBKU, QCRI and Doha Institute for Graduate Studies**, combining expertise in:
- Artificial Intelligence and Arabic NLP  
- Islamic studies and media ethics  
- Public policy and cross-cultural communication

## What we are building

Rather than focusing solely on content filtering, the project will develop AI-powered solutions that support:
- **Context-aware fact-checking**
- **Ethically grounded content moderation**
- **Constructive and dialogical cross-cultural engagement**

Key outcomes will include **benchmarking datasets, evaluation frameworks, and AI models** grounded in Islamic sources, international law, and human rights principles, alongside **digital literacy tools** and **AI-enhanced dialogue platforms**.

## Looking ahead

This is an active multi-year project (2025–2027). As the work progresses, we will release datasets, models, and research outputs to the community.

More updates and resources will be shared through our Hugging Face collection:
