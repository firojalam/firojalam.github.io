## EMNLP (Main & Findings)

At EMNLP, our work centered on explainable detection of propaganda and hateful content in multimodal settings:

- **MemeIntel: Explainable Detection of Propagandistic and Hateful Memes**  
  We introduce an explainable framework for detecting propaganda and hate in memes by jointly reasoning over text and image content.  
  🔗 **Data:** https://huggingface.co/datasets/QCRI/MemeXplain  
  🔗 **Model:** https://huggingface.co/QCRI/MemeIntel  
  🔗 **Paper:** https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.1539.pdf

- **PropXplain: Can LLMs Enable Explainable Propaganda Detection?**  
  This work explores how LLMs can provide human-interpretable explanations for propaganda detection, moving beyond simple labels toward richer narrative justifications.

## ArabicNLP 2025 (Conference & Shared Tasks)

At **ArabicNLP 2025**, we contributed to both the main conference and multiple shared tasks, with a strong focus on Arabic LLM benchmarking, culture, and multimodality:

- **BALSAM: A Platform for Benchmarking Arabic Large Language Models**  
  BALSAM, a unified platform for evaluating Arabic LLMs across tasks, domains, and varieties of Arabic.  
  🔗 **Platform:** https://benchmarks.ksaa.gov.sa/b/balsam  
  🔗 **Paper:** https://aclanthology.org/2025.arabicnlp-main.21.pdf

- **MarsadLab @ AraGenEval (Authorship Style Transfer & Identification)**  
  MarsadLab systems tackle authorship style transfer and identification, shedding light on stylistic signals in Arabic text.  
  🔗 **Paper:** https://aclanthology.org/2025.arabicnlp-sharedtasks.15.pdf

- **MAHED Shared Task: Multimodal Detection of Hope and Hate Emotions in Arabic Content**  
  We introduce MAHED for multimodal detection of hope and hate, bridging emotion recognition with socially impactful applications.  
  🔗 **Paper:** https://aclanthology.org/2025.arabicnlp-sharedtasks.75.pdf

- **CultranAI at PalmX 2025: Data Augmentation for Cultural Knowledge Representation**  
  CultranAI explores culturally aware data augmentation strategies to better ground LLMs in Arabic cultural contexts.  
  🔗 **Paper:** https://aclanthology.org/2025.arabicnlp-sharedtasks.111.pdf

- **MarsadLab at PalmX Shared Task: An LLM Benchmark for Arabic Culture and Islamic Civilization**  
  We contribute a benchmark focused on Arabic culture and Islamic civilization, designed for evaluating cultural competence in LLMs.  
  🔗 https://aclanthology.org/2025.arabicnlp-sharedtasks.112.pdf

- **AYA at PalmX 2025: Modeling Cultural and Islamic Knowledge in LLMs**  
  AYA investigates how LLMs can represent and reason about cultural and Islamic knowledge in a more faithful and responsible way.

## Community & Service

Beyond papers and systems, we have also organized a BoF session:

- **Organized BoF: Multilingual & Multimodal LLMs for Everyday Knowledge**  
  We organized a Birds of a Feather session that brought together researchers working on multilingual and multimodal LLMs, with a special focus on everyday, culturally grounded knowledge. The session highlighted open challenges, shared resources, and opportunities for collaboration across speech, vision, and text.
