I had the opportunity to give a talk at The First Arabic NLP Winter School, co-located with COLING 2025 in Abu Dhabi on January 18â€“19. My talk, titled "Benchmarking LLMs for Multilingual and Dialectal Challenges: Tools, Resources, and Future Directions," explored the evolving domain of large language models (LLMs) in handling multilingual and dialectal variations.

I discussed key benchmarking methodologies, highlighted essential tools (e.g., https://llmebench.qcri.org/) and resources, and outlined future research directions to improve LLM adaptability across diverse linguistic settings.
