We are organizing a [workshop on detecting AI-generated content](https://genai-content-detection.gitlab.io/), co-located with the [COLING 2025 conference](https://coling2025.org/), to tackle the increasing challenge of distinguishing between content created by humans and that generated by machines. As generative models continue to evolve, concerns about misinformation, copyright infringement, and the authenticity of digital media are becoming more pressing.

The workshop aims to unite researchers in developing innovative frameworks and strategies to detect generative content, with a particular focus on novel methodologies and resources. This timely event invites contributions that push the boundaries of current detection techniques, reflecting the urgent need for robust solutions in an era dominated by large language models.
