## 🎉 Tutorial Accepted at LREC 2026

We are pleased to announce that our tutorial proposal has been **accepted at LREC 2026**:

### **Multilingual and Multimodal LLMs in the Wild: Building for Low-Resource Languages**

This half-day tutorial will be delivered **in person at LREC 2026**, taking place at the **Palau de Congressos de Palma, Palma, Mallorca (Spain)**, from **11–16 May 2026**.

### 🧭 Tutorial Overview

Large Language Models are increasingly multilingual and multimodal, yet their real-world deployment for **low-resource languages** remains underexplored. This tutorial will provide a practical and research-driven perspective on:
- Designing **multilingual and multimodal LLMs** beyond high-resource settings  
- Addressing challenges in **data scarcity, cultural grounding, and evaluation**  
- Lessons learned from deploying models *in the wild* across diverse languages and modalities  

The session will combine **conceptual foundations**, **case studies**, and **hands-on insights**, targeting researchers and practitioners working on inclusive and globally representative language technologies.
