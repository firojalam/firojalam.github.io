The [ArAIEval](https://araieval.gitlab.io/) shared task, presented at [ArabicNLP 2024](https://arabicnlp2024.sigarab.org/), co-located with [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/), focused on detecting propagandistic techniques in Arabic content, including tweets, news articles, and memes. With 14 teams participating, the task highlighted the effectiveness of fine-tuning transformer models like AraBERT, and the datasets and evaluation scripts were released to the research community to foster further research in this area.
