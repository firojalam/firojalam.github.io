abstract={The recent literature reports several practical and important use cases of social media informatics where artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and other relevant technologies are employed to analyze human sufferings and infrastructure damage in natural disasters. While the textual content of social media platforms conveys relevant and useful information during a disaster, social media imagery content has also been proven very effective in analyzing the scale of damage to infrastructures such as roads, bridges, and buildings. Moreover, disaster-related visual content could also be analyzed to extract people's perceptions, emotions, sentiments, and responses to disasters, which can help different stakeholders, such as humanitarian organizations and policy-makers. Assessing such aspects of disaster events requires effective and efficient image processing methods to process a large amount social media content. This chapter reviews state-of-the-art techniques and shows their utility in processing social media image streams during disaster response for a diversified set of applications. It also highlights the key applications, challenges, available shared resources (datasets and models), tasks, and future research directions. This chapter will provide a ground for future research and a good starting point for the researchers in the domain.},

	abstract={The ever-increasing popularity of social media platforms has transformed the way in which information is shared during disasters and mass emergencies. Information that emanates from social media, especially in the early hours of a disaster when little-to-no information is available from other traditional sources, can be extremely valuable for emergency responders and decision makers to gain situational awareness and plan relief efforts. To capitalize on this potential, extensive research and development activities have been conducted over the last decade to build technologies to support various humanitarian aid tasks. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature on using artificial intelligence and social media for disaster response and management from three perspectives: datasets, research studies, and systems. Then, we present further discussion on open research problems and future directions in the crisis informatics domain.},

	abstract={Research in affective computing has mainly focused on analyzing human emotional states as perceivable within limited contexts such as speech utterances. In our study, we focus on the dynamic transitions of the emotional states that are appearing throughout the conversations and investigate computational models to automatically label emotional states using the proposed affective scene framework. An affective scene includes a complete sequence of emotional states in a conversation from its start to its end. Affective scene instances include different patterns of behavior such as who manifests an emotional state, when it is manifested, and which kinds of changes occur due to the influence of oneâ€™s emotion onto another interlocutor. In this paper, we present the design and training of an automatic affective scene segmentation and classification system for spoken conversations. We comparatively evaluate the contributions of different feature types in the acoustic, lexical and psycholinguistic space and their correlations and combination.},

	abstract={This paper presents a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system on broadcast news transcription where two different classifiers are set up in a loop so that the output of one of the classifiers is exploited by the other to refine its decision. The approach we followed is similar to that used in Typhoon, which is a NER system designed for newspaper articles; in that respect, one of the distinguishing features of our approach is the use of Conditional Random Fields in place of Hidden Markov Models. To make the second classifier we extracted sentences from a large unlabelled corpus. Another relevant feature is instead strictly related to transcription annotations. Transcriptions lack orthographic and punctuation information and this typically results in poor performance. As a result, an additional module for case and punctuation restoration has been developed. This paper describes the system and reports its performance which is evaluated by taking part in Evalita 2011 in the task of Named Entity Recognition on Transcribed Broadcast News. In addition, the Evalita 2009 dataset, consisting of newspapers articles, is used to present a comparative analysis by extracting named entities from newspapers and broadcast news.},
