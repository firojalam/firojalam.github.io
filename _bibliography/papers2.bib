abstract={The recent literature reports several practical and important use cases of social media informatics where artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and other relevant technologies are employed to analyze human sufferings and infrastructure damage in natural disasters. While the textual content of social media platforms conveys relevant and useful information during a disaster, social media imagery content has also been proven very effective in analyzing the scale of damage to infrastructures such as roads, bridges, and buildings. Moreover, disaster-related visual content could also be analyzed to extract people's perceptions, emotions, sentiments, and responses to disasters, which can help different stakeholders, such as humanitarian organizations and policy-makers. Assessing such aspects of disaster events requires effective and efficient image processing methods to process a large amount social media content. This chapter reviews state-of-the-art techniques and shows their utility in processing social media image streams during disaster response for a diversified set of applications. It also highlights the key applications, challenges, available shared resources (datasets and models), tasks, and future research directions. This chapter will provide a ground for future research and a good starting point for the researchers in the domain.},

	abstract={The ever-increasing popularity of social media platforms has transformed the way in which information is shared during disasters and mass emergencies. Information that emanates from social media, especially in the early hours of a disaster when little-to-no information is available from other traditional sources, can be extremely valuable for emergency responders and decision makers to gain situational awareness and plan relief efforts. To capitalize on this potential, extensive research and development activities have been conducted over the last decade to build technologies to support various humanitarian aid tasks. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature on using artificial intelligence and social media for disaster response and management from three perspectives: datasets, research studies, and systems. Then, we present further discussion on open research problems and future directions in the crisis informatics domain.},

	abstract={Research in affective computing has mainly focused on analyzing human emotional states as perceivable within limited contexts such as speech utterances. In our study, we focus on the dynamic transitions of the emotional states that are appearing throughout the conversations and investigate computational models to automatically label emotional states using the proposed affective scene framework. An affective scene includes a complete sequence of emotional states in a conversation from its start to its end. Affective scene instances include different patterns of behavior such as who manifests an emotional state, when it is manifested, and which kinds of changes occur due to the influence of one’s emotion onto another interlocutor. In this paper, we present the design and training of an automatic affective scene segmentation and classification system for spoken conversations. We comparatively evaluate the contributions of different feature types in the acoustic, lexical and psycholinguistic space and their correlations and combination.},

	abstract={People increasingly use microblogging platforms such as Twitter during natural disasters and emergencies. Research studies have revealed the usefulness of the data available on Twitter for several disaster response tasks. However, making sense of social media data is a challenging task due to several reasons such as limitations of available tools to analyse high-volume and high-velocity data streams, dealing with information overload, among others. To eliminate such limitations, in this work, we first show that textual and imagery content on social media provide complementary information useful to improve situational awareness. We then explore ways in which various Artificial Intelligence techniques from Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision fields can exploit such complementary information generated during disaster events. Finally, we propose a methodological approach that combines several computational techniques effectively in a unified framework to help humanitarian organisations in their relief efforts. We conduct extensive experiments using textual and imagery content from millions of tweets posted during the three major disaster events in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season. Our study reveals that the distributions of various types of useful information can inform crisis managers and responders and facilitate the development of future automated systems for disaster management.},

In this paper, we address two related problems in automatic affective behavior analysis: the design of the annotation protocol and the automatic recognition of empathy from human–human dyadic spoken conversations. We propose and evaluate an annotation scheme for empathy inspired by the modal model of emotions. The annotation scheme was evaluated on a corpus of real-life, dyadic spoken conversations. In the context of behavioral analysis, we designed an automatic segmentation and classification system for empathy. Given the different speech and language levels of representation where empathy may be communicated, we investigated features derived from the lexical and acoustic spaces. The feature development process was designed to support both the fusion and automatic selection of relevant features from a high dimensional space. The automatic classification system was evaluated on call center conversations where it showed significantly better performance than the baseline.},

	abstract={The extensive use of social media platforms, especially during disasters, creates unique opportunities for humanitarian organizations to gain situational awareness as disaster unfolds. In addition to textual content, people post overwhelming amounts of imagery content on social networks within minutes of a disaster hit. Studies point to the importance of this online imagery content for emergency response. Despite recent advances in computer vision research, making sense of the imagery content in real-time during disasters remains a challenging task. One of the important challenges is that a large proportion of images shared on social media is redundant or irrelevant, which requires robust filtering mechanisms. Another important challenge is that images acquired after major disasters do not share the same characteristics as those in large-scale image collections with clean annotations of well-defined object categories such as house, car, airplane, cat, dog, etc., used traditionally in computer vision research. To tackle these challenges, we present a social media image processing pipeline that combines human and machine intelligence to perform two important tasks: (i) capturing and filtering of social media imagery content (i.e., real-time image streaming, de-duplication, and relevancy filtering); and (ii) actionable information extraction (i.e., damage severity assessment) as a core situational awareness task during an on-going crisis event. Results obtained from extensive experiments on real-world crisis datasets demonstrate the significance of the proposed pipeline for optimal utilization of both human and machine computing resources.},

We automatically annotated personality types and communication styles of Twitter users and analyzed the correlations between personality, communication style, Twitter metadata (such as followig and folllowers) and the type of mood associated to the articles they shared. We also run a feature selection task, to find the best predictors of positive and negative mood sharing, and a classification task.

	abstract={Images shared on social media help crisis managers gain situational awareness and assess incurred damages, among other response tasks. As the volume and velocity of such content are typically high, real-time image classification has become an urgent need for a faster disaster response. Recent advances in computer vision and deep neural networks have enabled the development of models for real-time image classification for a number of tasks, including detecting crisis incidents, filtering irrelevant images, classifying images into specific humanitarian categories, and assessing the severity of the damage. To develop robust real-time models, it is necessary to understand the capability of the publicly available pre-trained models for these tasks, which remains to be under-explored in the crisis informatics literature. In this study, we address such limitations by investigating ten different network architectures for four different tasks using the largest publicly available datasets for these tasks. We also explore various data augmentation strategies, semi-supervised techniques, and a multitask learning setup. In our extensive experiments, we achieve promising results.},

We collected data of more than 2000 Twitter users who shared news articles from Corriere.it, a daily newspaper that provides mood metadata annotated by readers on a voluntary basis. We automatically annotated personality types and communication styles of Twitter users and analyzed the correlations between personality, communication style, Twitter metadata (such as followig and folllowers) and the type of mood associated to the articles they shared. We also run a feature selection task, to find the best predictors of positive and negative mood sharing, and a classification task. We automatically predicted positive and negative mood sharers with 61.7% F1-measure.}
