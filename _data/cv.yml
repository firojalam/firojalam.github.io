        - <strong>Segmenting Emotional Episodes:</strong> Currently working on the problem of segmenting and classifying emotional episodes in conversations. In a call center conversation, a client might be angry at some point of the conversation and perhaps after some time, he/she might be happy or show satisfactory expressions. In my research, I am trying to automatically segment these temporal emotional phenomena using machine-learning approaches.
        - <strong>Conversation Summarization:</strong> We are working on summarizing conversations in terms of emotion, topic, and sentiment by utilizing NLP and Machine Learning techniques from speech and social media. Conversation summarization is a part of a European Union funded project aimed to advance the next-generation analytics technology (http://www.sensei-conversation.eu).
        - <strong>Affective Behavioral Signals Recognition Systems:</strong> Designed and developed an emotion recognizer as part of an emotion analytics system. Our study mainly focused on understanding whether the agent is empathic or not while the client is angry or frustrated.
        - <strong>Personality Trait Recognition Systems:</strong> Designed and developed Personality Trait Recognition Systems in domains such as broadcast news, human-human conversation, and social media (e.g., Facebook, YouTube) by utilizing acoustic, linguistic, and psycholinguistic information with machine learning algorithms.
        - <strong>Open Source Tools:</strong> (e.g., Personality traits scorer, LOSO-split, LIWC-web-client using Java and Python).
        - <strong>Research Intern, HLT Unit, Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK-irst), Trento, Italy. June 2011 – October 2011:</strong> Designed Named Entity Recognition System for broadcast news transcription, which also works for newspaper text.
        - <strong>Evalita-2011:</strong> Participated in the Evalita-2011 evaluation campaign where my work ranked as the best system.
